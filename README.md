# üåç Project Nexus ‚Äì Social Media Feed (ProDev Frontend Engineering)

## üìñ Project Overview
Project Nexus is a **dynamic social media feed application** built as part of the **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**.  
The goal is to design and implement a **modern, interactive platform** that allows users to create, share, and engage with content in real time.  

This repository serves as a **documentation hub** for my major learnings, challenges, and best practices throughout the program.

## üéØ Objectives
- Build a **modern frontend application** (Web, Mobile, or PWA) with **Next.js and React**.  
- Use **GraphQL** and **API integration** for dynamic data handling.  
- Apply **TailwindCSS** for responsive, reusable UI components.  
- Implement **state management** with Redux / Apollo Client.  
- Showcase understanding of **System Design & Analysis**.
